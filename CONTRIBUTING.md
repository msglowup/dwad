# Contributing to This Project

Thanks for considering making a contribution to Seal or its documentation. Before you get started, please take a moment to read these guidelines.

## Important Note

We appreciate contributions, but **simple typo fixes (e.g., minor spelling errors, punctuation changes, or trivial rewording) will be ignored** unless they significantly improve clarity or fix a critical issue. If you are unsure whether your change is substantial enough, consider opening an issue first to discuss it.

## Example Frontend Application

The example frontend in this repository is provided as a reference implementation only. We will not accept pull requests for UI/UX improvements or cosmetic changes to the example frontend unless they fix actual bugs or critical issues. The example is meant to demonstrate functionality, not serve as a production-ready application.

We encourage you to use this example as a starting point for your own frontend applications. If you build upon this example to create your own implementation, we'd love to hear about it! Feel free to share your projects with the community, and we may highlight notable implementations in our documentation or community channels.
